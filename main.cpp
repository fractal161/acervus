// Sketch of what needs to happen
/*
Store all ranks in "ranks." Use mmap to load each value into a gigantic array for quick lookup.

Write a library for manipulating surfaces (adding pieces, evaluating decisions, etc.)

Different program for actually running iterations of pagerank. Make sure it can check for convergence and all.

Main method should use x11 and xdotool (?) to test the ranks on the James Clewett challenge (REMEMBER TO USE GUEST ACCOUNT)
